            We‚Äôre a small but nimble family-run take out and delivery pizza shop in Okotoks, Alberta. When we‚Äôre not
            scouring the globe (okay, the prairies) for the freshest, ripest and boldest ingredients, we‚Äôre crafting
            perfect
            pizzas for you and your family to enjoy. From hot Hawaiians and classic Canadians to crispy wings and
            decadent
            fudge brownies, everything at Okotoks Pizza is baked with love.
          </p>

            After watching his parents run a very successful pizza business in Calgary, Matt Cleveland learned how to
            make
            people happy, one topping at a time. Opening the doors to Okotoks Pizza in 2004, Matt has managed to evolve
            the
            fresh, traditional Greek-style pizza his family perfected back in the mid 80s to a more modern and
            convenient
            comfort food for today‚Äôs family on the go.
          </p>

            Flax
            crust. You feel good about ordering it. You feel good about eating it. And you feel even better knowing
