          Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right? Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the
          Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don’t eat the tourists. This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio,
          reclining
          bucket seats, and... power windows.

          Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! You really think you can fly that thing? Do you have any idea how long
          it
          takes those cups to decompose. Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right? My dad
          once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little
          bastard!
        </p>

          God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. Do
          you
          have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose. I was part of something special. Checkmate...
          Checkmate... You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager?

          This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows. Jaguar shark! So
          tell
          me - does it really exist? Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance.

          Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! You really think you can fly that thing? Did he just throw my cat out of
          the window? Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don’t eat the tourists.
          Is
          this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine?
