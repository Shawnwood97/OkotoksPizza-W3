          Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right? Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the
          Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don’t eat the tourists. This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio,
          reclining
          bucket seats, and... power windows.

          This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows. Jaguar shark! So
          tell
          me - does it really exist? Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance.

          the window? Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don’t eat the tourists.
